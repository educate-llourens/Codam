# Description
## Brief overview
We implemented a maze generator in Python that takes a configuration file, generates a
maze, eventually perfect (with a single path between entrance and exit), and writes it to a
file using a hexadecimal wall representation. We also provided a visual representation
of the maze and organized our code so that the generation logic can be reused later.

## Goals of this project
[ ] Create a maze generator from a config file
[ ] Generate a perfect maze
[ ] Create a visual representation of the maze
[ ] Ensure it is appropriately packaged for reusing later
